      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>Hi! My name is Andrew Bernklau and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. I found my passion for coding in college when I took an Intro to Python class with my best friend.
        In 2021, while dancing around the many interests I had in science, I realized developing was the route I wanted to take, and to it I have stuck.
        Now I have worked on multiple projects designing machine learning algorithms and web applications.
        My favorite technologies include the full MERN stack of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js. I have used them to create web applications that involve simple CRUD operations as well responsive interfaces.
        All of which you can find on my github, <a href="https://github.com/abernklau1">here</a>.</p>
