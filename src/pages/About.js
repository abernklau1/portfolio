    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Hi! My name is Andrew Bernklau and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. I found my passion for coding in college when I took an Intro to Python class with my best friend.
      In 2021, while dancing around the many interests I had like microbiology and astrophysics, I realized I wanted to code for the rest of my life.
      Now I have worked on multiple projects designing machine learning algorithms and web applications.
      My favorite technologies include the full MERN stack of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js. I have used them to create web application that involve simple CRUD operations as well responsive interfaces.
      All of which you can find on my github, <a href="https://github.com/abernklau1">here</a></p>
